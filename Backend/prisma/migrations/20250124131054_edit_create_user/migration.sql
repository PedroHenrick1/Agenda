  Warnings:

  - You are about to alter the column `firstName` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(100)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `lastName` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(100)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `email` on the `User` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(100)`.
  - A unique constraint covering the columns `[email]` on the table `User` will be added. If there are existing duplicate values, this will fail.
  - Added the required column `password` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
